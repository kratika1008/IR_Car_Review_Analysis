Review Text is a free content that allows users to express as much as they want. Rating is a quantitative measure of the goodness of the product or service. But does the rating define the quality the same way as much as the review text does?
It's important to analyze the review content and calculate the rating value based on that.

The user has provided a review related to a product with a product rating:

Review: Why would all 3 timing chains need replacing at only 36000 miles?
Customer Rating: 5.0

However, the review doesn't read that positive.
We performed analysis on Sentiment Review text using VaderSentiment and evaluated a better rating for the rating.

Our model suggests: 3.9

which is a better measure of the review content.
