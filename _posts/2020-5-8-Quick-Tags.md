Having access to huge amount of reviews is surely helpful, however going through all reviews is cumbersome. We have generated quick tags (Bigrams & Trigrams) for each Car Model that provide a summary of the model in few words that will help:

1. Customers easily get an idea of what is the most talked about feature or the biggest problem with the car.
2. Car companies to identify improvement areas to provide better customer experience.

Some Bigrams:

gas mileage; daily driver; years old; manual transmission; air intake; plenty power; best owned; american muscle; fuel economy

Some Trigrams:

check engine light; accord ex v6; better gas mileage; adaptive cruise control; accord exl v6; rear brake pads; accord v6 coupe; power steering pump
